/** a resource. Resources implement asynchronicity

 * <p>
 * A WfActivity can advertise that it needs a certain resource. The engine can then do some planning. 
 * The engine will acquire/release the resource FOR the action...the action doesn't have to
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> the WfActivity advertises that it needs the resource
 * <li> the engine will acquire it. the acquire is not blocking...the resource will notify the engine when it was acquired
 * <li> the action uses the resource: sends requests. These are non-blocking
 * <li> IF the resource says anything except RRWAIT, then action gets result and continues
 * <li> IF the resource says RRWAIT, then the current processing thread is suspended waiting for the resource
 * 
 * TODO need lifecycle management - I might end up re-implementing JCAA ??
 * TODO need transactionability - when to persist/rollback etc. should use context for that
